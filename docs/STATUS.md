# Status

**Phase:** PRD review (before development)
**Last updated:** 2026-10-31

## In progress

_Nothing. The next agent may start._

## Next

1. Clarify learning and recovery rules in the PRD, one question at a time. Still open: Leitner scheduling, learning-day and time counting, backup restore and forgotten PIN handling.
   - Paused by the product owner after D-24. Next question: Leitner scheduling (F-12, F-13) — how often each box comes back.
2. Approve the PRD (gate "PRD approved").
3. Choose the tech stack and fill in "Stack and structure" in `AGENTS.md`.

## Done

- Public repository created.
- Lesson and level completion rules and sticker album: D-21–D-24 (F-34, F-15, F-19), PRD v0.5.
- PRD v0.4 (`docs/PRD.md`); D-18–D-20 reviewed with the product owner: bundled open emoji set, per-profile themes, British English.
- README.
- Agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and this status file.
